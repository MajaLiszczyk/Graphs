# Graphs
Description: This program calculates the shortest path (lowest cost) between nodes in the graph. The user has two options in the menu - adding graph as a matrix to the database or finding a path in an existing matrix. To create a new matrix, the user must provide its size and name (the name is mandatory and cannot exceed 25 characters). The user then fills in the matrix with weights, where 'x' represents infinity. To find the shortest path between two nodes in an existing matrix, the user selects the desired matrix, then chooses the starting and ending nodes. After making the selections, the user receives the result.

How to start:
1. Build project (generate .war file)
2. Install and configure web server for java (e.g: Payara, Apache Tomcat)
3. Deploy .war file
3. Enjoy!
